## About

This repository is used to develop standardisation proposals for
Bfloat16 (Brain Float 16) instruction set extensions for the RISC-V
architecture.

<!--
// I don't think this Task Group has a wiki page (or I could not find it)
// For a general overview of the extension status and ratification progress,
// please see 
// [our page on the RISC-V Wiki](https://wiki.riscv.org/x/MVcF).
-->

- **Note:** See the
   [main](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-bfloat16/tree/main)
   branch for the most up to date version.

- **Note:** These instructions are a work in progress. Their specifications
  will to change before being accepted as part of the RISC-V standard.  While
  there are *experimental* encodings assigned to the proposed instructions,
  they *should not* be depended upon.  They only exist to enable a toolchain
  and simulator flow.  They *will* change.

- See the [project board](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-bfloat16/issues)
  for a list of on-going  / open issues.
