[[crypto_scalar_policies]]
=== Policies

In creating this proposal, we tried to adhere to the following
policies:

* Provide a RISC-V BFloat16 definition that makes sense for how we expect
these operands to be used in real applications.
* Provide the basic instructions that allow implementations to leverage the
benefits of the BFloat16 format +
** reduced storage space - A BFloat16 operand consumes half the space of an FP32 operand +
** higher effective storage bandwidth - Two BFloat16 operands can be transferred at the same rate as one FP32 +
** higher computational throughput - Two BFloat16 multiplies can be performed with less logic than one FP32 +
* Provide consistency with other approaches when this doesn't interfere with
the above
