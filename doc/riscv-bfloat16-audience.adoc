=== Intended Audience
 THIS IS VERY PRELIMINARY - TO BE UPDATED

Floating-point arithmetic is a specialized subject, requiring people with many different
backgrounds to cooperate in its correct and efficient implementation.
Where possible, we have written this specification to be understandable by
all, though we recognize that the motivations and references to
algorithms or other specifications and standards may be unfamiliar to those
who are not domain experts.

This specification anticipates being read and acted on by various people
with different backgrounds.
We have tried to capture these backgrounds
here, with a brief explanation of what we expect them to know, and how
it relates to the specification.
We hope this aids people's understanding of which aspects of the specification
are particularly relevant to them, and which they may (safely!) ignore or
pass to a colleague.

Software developers::
These are the people we expect to write code using the instructions
in this specification.
They should understand fairly obviously the motivations for the
instructions we include, and be familiar with most of the algorithms
and outside standards to which we refer.

Computer architects::
We do  expect architects to have a floating-point background.
We nonetheless expect architects to be able to examine our instructions
for implementation issues, understand how the instructions will be used
in context, and advise on how best to fit the functionality the
cryptographers want to the ISA interface.

Digital design engineers & micro-architects::
These are the people who will implement the specification inside a
core. Floating-point expertise is assumed as not all of the corner
cases are pointed out in the specification.

Verification engineers::
Responsible for ensuring the correct implementation of the extension
in hardware.


These are by no means the only people concerned with the specification,
but they are the ones we considered most while writing it.
