Description:: 
Convert FP32 to BF16. Round according to the RM field. 

This new floating-point-to-floating-point conversion instruction is defined analogously to the other floating-point-to-floating-point conversion instructions.
This instruction is similar to vfncvt.f.f.w - Convert double-width float to single-width float. However, it is only defined for SEW=16.
Any attempt to execute this instruction with an SEW other than SEW=16 will result in an invalid instruction exception.

Unlike other BF16 instructions, the conversion instructions consume and produce subnormal values.

Exceptions: Overflow, Inexact, Invalid
