Description:: 
Narrowing convert from FP32 to BF16. Round according to the _frm_ register. 

// This new vector floating-point-to-floating-point conversion instruction is defined analogously to
// the pre-existing floating-point-to-floating-point conversion instructions.
This instruction is similar to `vfncvt.f.f.w` - Convert double-width float to single-width float.
However, the single-width float is limited to the BF16 format.


Exceptions:  Overflow, Underflow, Inexact, Invalid
