Description:: 
Convert BF16 to FP32. The conversion is exact.

This new floating-point-to-floating-point conversion instruction is defined analogously to the other floating-point-to-floating-point conversion instructions.
This instruction is similar to vfwcvt.f.f.v - Convert single-width float to double-width float. However, it is only defined for SEW=16.
Any attempt to execute this instruction with an SEW other than 16 will result in an invalid instruction exception.

Unlike other BF16 instructions, the conversion instructions consume and produce subnormal values.

Exceptions: Invalid
