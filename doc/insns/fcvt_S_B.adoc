=== FCVT.S.B

Synopsis::
Convert FP32 value to an FP32 value

Mnemonic::
FCVT.S.B rd, rs1

Encoding::

{bits: 7, name: 'OP-FP'},
{bits: 5, name: 'rd'},
{bits: 3, name: 'rm'},

Note::
The "H.B16" field is intended to signify that the source is 16 bits to be interpreted as BF16.
We need to see what encodings are currently used here, and if there is any room for such encodings.

Description:: 
Convert BF16 value to an FP32 value. The conversion is exact.

This new floating-point-to-floating-point conversion instruction is defined analogously to the other floating-point-to-floating-point conversion instructions.

Unlike other BF16 instructions, the conversion instructions consume and produce subnormal values.

[Note]
.Encoding
While the mnemonic of this instruction matches that of the other RISC-V floating-point convert instructions, the coding is necessarily different as all of the fmt encodings have been assigned to other floating-point formats.

Exceptions: Invalid
