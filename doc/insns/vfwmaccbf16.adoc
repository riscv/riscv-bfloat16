|Definition

| Vd      | input  | 32  | FP32 Accumulate
| Vs1/rs1 | input  | 16  | BF16 Source
| Vs2     | input  | 16  | BF16 Source
| Vd      | output | 32  | FP32 Result

Description:: 

This instruction performs a widening fused multiply-accumulate
operation, where each pair of BF16 values are multiplied and their
unrounded product is added to the corresponding FP32 accumulate value.
The sum is rounded according to the _frm_ register.


In the vector-vector version, the BF16 elements are read from `vs1`
and `vs2` and FP32 accumulate value is read from `vd`. The FP32 result
is written to the destination register `vd`.

The vector-scalar version is similar, but instead of reading elements
from `vs1`, a scalar BF16 value is read from the FPU register `rs1`.  


Exceptions: Overflow, Underflow, Inexact, Invalid

Operation::

This `vfwmaccbf16.vv` instruction is equivalent to widening each of the BF16 inputs to
FP32 and then performing an FMACC as shown in the following
instruction sequence:

[source,asm]
--
vfwcvtbf16.f.f.v T1, vs1, vm
vfwcvtbf16.f.f.v T2, vs2, vm
vfmacc.vv        vd, T1, T2, vm
--

Likewise, `vfwmaccbf16.vf` is equivalent to the following instruction sequence:

[source,asm]
--
fcvt.s.bf16      T1, rs1
vfwcvtbf16.f.f.v T2, vs2, vm
vfmacc.vf        vd, T1, T2, vm
--
