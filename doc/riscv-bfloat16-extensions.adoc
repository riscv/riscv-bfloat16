[[BF16_extensions]]
== Extensions

The group of extensions introduced by the BF16 Instruction Set
Extensions is listed here.

Detection of individual BF16 extensions uses the
unified software-based RISC-V discovery method.

[NOTE]
====
At the time of writing, these discovery mechanisms are still a work in
progress.
====

The BF16 extensions defined in this specification depend on the single-precision floating-point extension
`F`.

This initial set of BF16 extensions provides very basic functionality including scalar and vector conversion between BF16 and single-precision values, and vector widening multiply-add instructions.
