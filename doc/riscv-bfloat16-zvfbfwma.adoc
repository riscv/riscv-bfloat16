=== `Zvfbfwma` - Vector BF16 widening mul-add

This extension provides
a vector widening BF16 mul-add instruction that accumulates into FP32. 

This extension includes the `FLH`, `FSH`, `FMV.X.H`, and `FMV.H.X` instructions
that are defined in the `Zfh` spec.

[NOTE]
====
The scalar load and move instructions are included so that BF16 scalar operands can be provided
for the vector-scalar `vfwmaccbf16.vf` instruction.
